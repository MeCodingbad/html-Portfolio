<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My fascination with technology traces back recently and not long ago, where each encounter
   with a computer or electronic device ignited a sense of wonder and curiosity within me.
     In my late 20s, as I am turning 30, I found myself increasingly captivated by the limitless possibilities 
     that technology offered.
     This infatuation blossomed into an obsession, driving me to explore programming languages,
      software development, and the intricate workings of computer systems.
      Eager to transform this passion into a career, I pursued to earn certificates online courses
      and immersed myself in hands-on projects.
      The thrill of solving complex problems through coding and witnessing 
      the tangible impact of software development fueled my determination.
      This relentless pursuit led me on a path to becoming a software engineer, where
       I now channel my passion into creating innovative solutions,
       contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
      The journey from fascination to obsession and, ultimately, to
       a fulfilling career as a software engineer is a testament 
       to my unwavering dedication to the transformative power of technology.
